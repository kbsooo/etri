# ETRI Sleep Lifestyle Competition Workspace

This repository snapshot is rooted at the former local `cl2/` workspace.

Current public frontier:

- `analysis_outputs/submission_e247_featnn1_nn_smooth_sum_top34_f1ff7e86.csv`
- Public LB: `0.5761589494`
- Previous frontier: `analysis_outputs/submission_e95_hardtail_541e3973.csv`
- Improvement over previous frontier: `0.0001323804`
- Latest resolved public sensor: `analysis_outputs/submission_e256_featnn1_top50_amp_then_smooth25_a3827329.csv` public LB `0.5762805676`, which rejects the amplitude-constrained E247 follow-up while keeping feature-NN1 Q3 smoothing positive versus E95.
- Latest public-free diagnostic: E316 human placement-health learner. It uses no public LB. It shows human diary signatures almost perfectly identify intended E315 placements against row/subject/dateblock nulls, but that identity signal is not enough to certify action health. Current policy is no public submission until a candidate proves mode-specific placement health locally, not just semantic plausibility or actual-vs-null identity.

The local `analysis_outputs/` directory contains many generated scan tables.
Only scripts, reports, summary/audit tables, and key submission files are tracked
in git; large generated artifacts remain local by design.
