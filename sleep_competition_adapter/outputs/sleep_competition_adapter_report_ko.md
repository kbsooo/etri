# Sleep Competition Adapter Report

이 문서는 HS-JEPA Core를 수면 생활습관 로그 대회에 적용하는 adapter를 설명한다.

## Adapter Claim

This adapter converts HS-JEPA Core into a sleep-log competition system by supplying Q/S listeners, a route invariant, public-sensor action evidence, and upload-safe sparse row-target decoding.

## Score Evidence

- Pre-public-equation best public LB: `0.5761589494`
- Current best public LB: `0.5677475939`
- Delta: `-0.00841135550000005`
- Current best file: `submission_h057_q2row_fullvector_state_7cde1a77_uploadsafe.csv`

## Core to Adapter Mapping

| Core module | Sleep adapter instantiation | Evidence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `context_encoder` | raw lifestyle, subject/cohort, row-order, and sleep-state context features | cell-level human-state orientation AUC 0.775 | row-level assignment AUC 0.545 is not enough for standalone assignment. |
| `masked_state_predictor` | teacher/student probes for hidden S2-hub and row-target support orientation | human-state probe exists as a role-based output | current strongest teacher still uses public-sensitive action support. |
| `listener_responsibility` | Q/S targets are treated as listeners; S2 emerges as an objective-stage hub | S2 listener usage 1.000 vs null 0.615 | S2 hub is a sleep competition case-study claim, not a universal physiology claim. |
| `action_health_decoder` | public-positive and public-negative sensors define toxic action diagnostics | mechanism ablation kills broad/toxic alternatives before release | public LB sensor is not portable and must be replaced for non-competition deployments. |
| `invariant_energy` | Q/S route energy and route-conserving S2 bridge | route z-scores primary=-9.66, s2=-9.46 | other domains need their own temporal, physiological, semantic, or cohort invariant. |
| `anti_shortcut_validation` | upload safety, feasible-bundle nulls, mechanism knockout, and release checklist | generality checks 5/6 | private LB safety is not proven. |

## OG-only Assignment Probe

- Status: `og_only_assignment_replacement_not_ready`
- Pure OG row-cap2 recall: `0.0404`
- Distilled row-cap2 recall: `0.1236`
- Listener/source upper-bound row-cap2 recall: `0.1356`

Human-state explains action orientation, but the safe row-target assignment still needs adapter-side evidence.

## Listener-Invariant Contrastive Probe

- Status: `listener_invariant_decoder_not_ready`
- Mean listener-route Spearman: `-0.0313`
- Mean contrastive overlap: `0.2152`
- Mean conflict rate: `0.0719`

Listener responsibility and invariant safety are not sufficiently aligned; use this as a diagnostic before making new submissions.

## Private-Safe Toxicity Probe

- Status: `toxicity_field_promising_with_hardworld_gap`
- Mean leave-one-bad-anchor AUC: `0.7880`
- Worst leave-one-bad-anchor AUC: `0.3683`
- Selected safety z vs matched null: `8.4589`

The toxicity field is strong on most bad anchors, but a hard-world toxicity mode is still not captured.

## Role Outputs

## 이 adapter가 증명하는 것

- HS-JEPA-style listener/action/invariant separation can explain the 0.567 public-LB breakthrough case study.
- Route-conserving action selection is statistically non-random against feasible null bundles.
- Human-state latent explains target/cell orientation but not enough row assignment on its own.
- A pure OG-only assignment teacher is not ready yet; this is now a measured architecture boundary, not an informal caveat.
- A naive listener-invariant contrastive decoder is not ready yet; listener responsibility and route safety are weakly anti-aligned in current candidates.
- The toxicity field generalizes across many bad public anchors and beats matched nulls, but still misses a hard-world toxicity mode.

## 이 adapter가 아직 증명하지 못한 것

- pure OG-only assignment
- private leaderboard safety
- S2 as a universal human-sleep factor
- that public LB sensors can be used outside this competition
- that listener responsibility alone is an action-grade decoder
- that toxicity diagnostics prove private leaderboard safety
